        <p><strong>The French Bulldog’s</strong> motto is “Love the one you’re with.” Big eyes, pointy ears, snub nose
            with its compact bundle of a body and inquisitively puckered face, the French bulldog is irresistibly cute.
            With a tough-on-the-outside, sweet-on-the-inside demeanor, unmistakable bat-shaped ears and distinctive
            bow-legged gait, the French Bulldog has gained so much popularity.
            The Frenchie will make you laugh. He's a charming, clever dog with a sense of humor and a stubborn streak.
            The French Bulldog is an amazing dog. She is very smart but loves to play and have fun. With such a puppy,
            you will definitely not get bored.
